## Math Extension install

Utilizing Math extension as a base, with the online/offline server setup.

Pt 1.
Install Math via composer.local.json addition in the online server.
composer install
Grep reveals that the changes are in `extensions/math` .
Running the online server reveals that Math is not yet integrated with the wiki
edit LocalSettings with wfLoadExtension('Math'); or some variant for the extension
run php update, this should build tables to make the extension work

Pt 2.
Download the extension Math, and move it to the offline server's directory extensions/Math, creating the folder if not already present
Add wfLoadExtension('Math'); to LocalSettings.php in the offline server's root directory
Run php maintenence/update script

Verification Step:
Open the checked wiki's special:version page to determine the integrated extensions.
