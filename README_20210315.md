# Updating SMW on an Offline Server

 

## Components:

* 1 x Offline Wiki Server
* 1 x Wiki Server with Web Access (Composer-enabled)

 
## Process:

### Step 1

We assume that an offline Wiki server has been set up with the necessary prerequisites for a Mediawiki server: Apache, mysql, PHP, and the mediawiki software.


Excerpt:

    echo "FROM mediawiki:latest" > Dockerfile.mw
    docker build -f Dockerfile.mw -t mw . 
    echo "MYSQL_PW=example" > .env


### Step 2

The Offline Server is running two docker containers: a PHP server and the MariaDB server.

### Step 3

From this point, we are creating a separate server, one that has internet access.

### Step 4


Swapping to the server with web access, we download mediawiki and then we install said wiki using Composer. In this step, we set up a mediawiki similar to the one set up for the Offline wiki, with the same requisite components. We may use identical containers as the Offline wiki, but they can not be shared between the two wikis, as we are maintaining separation. The following procedure assumes a setup web server for the wiki.

Setup process for Mediawiki (this can be substituted for a different setup process):

    wget https://releases.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.35/mediawiki-1.35.1.tar.gz
    tar xvzf mediawiki-*.tar.gz

These unzipped files are then uploaded to the server’s web directory.

Afterwards, we set up a new database (assuming we are initializing a new wiki. Otherwise, skip this subsection.)

This can be done during the mediawiki installation script or manually via MySQL commands:

    CREATE DATABASE wikidb;
    CREATE USER …
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES …

Run the installation script via web browser directed at your server’s address on the hard drive, and download the LocalSettings.php file to the Online Server’s MediaWiki folder. Alternatively, do this process via command line with:

    php maintenance/install.php

End setup process for Mediawiki
 

### Step 5

We then install composer:

    php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
    php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '756890a4488ce9024fc62c56153228907f1545c228516cbf63f885e036d37e9a59d27d63f46af1d4d07ee0f76181c7d3') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
    php composer-setup.php
    php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

This allows us to run composer via:

    php composer.phar

in the folder where the .phar file is placed.

Create a composer.local.json file in the format

    {
      "require": {
            "mediawiki/semantic-media-wiki": "~3.0"
      }
    }

Add additional extensions in the require section as needed, with comma separation.

The composer json should be in the base directory of your mediawiki online installation. This .local.json identifies the extensions that you wish to install into your wiki.



Afterwards, run the update and maintenance scripts, which load the extensions into the file structure.



      php composer.phar update –no-dev //may need to run this command twice
      php maintenance/update.php //may need a –skip-external-dependencies flag



In "LocalSettings.php":



Add:

      require_once “$IP/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/SemanticMediaWiki.php”;
      enableSemantics( ‘wikidomainname.address’);

as a call at the end of the file, replacing the domain name as needed.

Check and verify installation in the online wiki.

This addition enables SMW on the wiki.



Rerun the update + maintenance scripts, and run a database refresh:

    php extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/maintenance/rebuildData.php -d 50 -v

### Step 6

Now having a fully updated online SMW installation, we create an individual file release to gain a copy of the extensions. This script then has it’s permissions modified for user access only before activation.

Download IndividualFileRelease.sh from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SemanticMediaWiki/IndividualFileRelease/master/IndividualFileRelease.sh



    curl -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SemanticMediaWiki/IndividualFileRelease/master/IndividualFileRelease.sh
    chmod 700 IndividualFileRelease.sh
    ./IndividualFileRelease.sh

The resultant files from this are then moved to the OFFLINE server. This is not a compressed version.

### Step 7

We swap back to working on the Offline server, transferring the files produced by the IFR in /var/tmp/mediawiki to the offline server.

### Step 8

Having moved the files from the IFR to the offline server (it isn’t in a tarball or compressed format, unless you manually made one), the files are copied into the base directory of the MediaWiki installation.

    /var/www/html/mediawiki

Modify the offline installation’s LocalSettings.php file, adding:

    require_once “$IP/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/SemanticMediaWiki.php”;
    enableSemantics( ‘wikidomainname.address’);



In addition to optional settings, as requested.

Afterwards, run:

      php maintenance/update.php

on the offline server from the base directory.

Alternatively, as an wiki admin, goto “Special:SMWAdmin” and:

1. Click on “initialize or upgrade tables” in Database installation and upgrade.
1. Click on “Start updating data”

### Step 9

Verify extension installation for the offline wiki.
